      <description>All commands are written with the universal dh! prefix.
Alternatively, you can use the prefix set on your server too, (the default is !) which can be changed by server owners.
Arguments to the commands listed below are specified with &amp;lt;&amp;gt; if they must be specified, and with [] otherwise. Please donâ€™t type the brackets on commands, thanks :)
You can pass a player as an argument using his/her User ID, a mention, their nickname, or their username and Discord tag.</description>

      <description>How do I play? Playing DuckHunt is easy. When a duck (a message sent by the bot looking like ðŸ¦† &amp;lt; COUAAC) appears in the channel, use the dh!bang command to kill it. You can reload your weapon with dh!reload when you have no more bullets in your current clip.
You can also access the shop using dh!shop [name of the item you want] to buy objects you&amp;rsquo;ll need in your hunting career.</description>

      <description>First, Iâ€™d like to thank HostMyServers for providing me a server to host DuckHunt on. It is fast, reliable and well-supported!

 Join our discord server to get support if needed. You can ask a @Moderator to get the @Server Owner role, reserved for admins of DuckHunt on their servers! Invite the bot to your server by clicking here In the channel you want to use, type !</description>
